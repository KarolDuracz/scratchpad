Maybe some useful stuff for future learning
<br /><br />
Untitled1.ipynb --> https://github.com/EurekaLabsAI/micrograd
<br /><br />
This file Untitled1.ipynb has some example code to compare with binary classification example from Andrej's micrograd EurekaLabs repo. 
<br /><br />
Untitled3.ipynb is for this track_simulator demos ==> https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/tree/main/Webapp/Simple%20http%20server%20python3
<br />
There is some example calculation using chain rule to calculate some stuff for basic physics and game engine : tyre consumption against temperature,humidity and speed. But this is simple introduce for this issue. Like I wrote in that repo, here is a lot of things starting but not finalized. Once again, maybe someday...
<br /><br />
At this moment this is all I have and might be some interesting in future to continue learning<br />
