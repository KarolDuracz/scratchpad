05-09-2024 - The moment we stopped understanding AI [AlexNet] ((Welch Labs) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZDiGooFs54&ab_channel=WelchLabs <br />
Interesing wideo. And this is just the beginning, like the first computers. Year after year... but here we are, and we have the opportunity to learn from the best people on this field, like Andrej Karpathy. What will happen in next 10, 20, 30 years? I wonder what we will say then... ML, this is not my filed, but I like statistics and plots. Tesla autopilot, GPT 4 and other stuff from Open AI, Deep Mind / Google Brain etc show us, this is serious game! So.... ?
<br /><br />
Another great example video is in this channel on YT, and series videos about ML and LLM, <b>but this is important fact!</b> from 13:14 - https://youtu.be/9-Jl0dxWQs8?t=794 -- "but if that neuron was inactive, if that number was zero, then this would have NO EFFECT".

Maybe some useful stuff for future learning
<br /><br />
Untitled1.ipynb --> https://github.com/EurekaLabsAI/micrograd
<br /><br />
This file Untitled1.ipynb has some example code to compare with binary classification example from Andrej's micrograd EurekaLabs repo. 
<br /><br />
Untitled3.ipynb is for this track_simulator demos ==> https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/tree/main/Webapp/Simple%20http%20server%20python3
<br />
There is some example calculation using chain rule to calculate some stuff for basic physics and game engine : tyre consumption against temperature,humidity and speed. But this is simple introduce for this issue. Like I wrote in that repo, here is a lot of things starting but not finalized. Once again, maybe someday...
<br /><br />
At this moment this is all I have and might be some interesting in future to continue learning<br />
