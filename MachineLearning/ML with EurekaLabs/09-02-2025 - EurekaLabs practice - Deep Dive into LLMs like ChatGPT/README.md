<h2>Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT
- The new video post by Andrej</h2>
https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI - 2:35:11 - About DeepSeek R1 thinking process. Great idea.
<br /><br />
A ton of knowledge with high quality as always. <br /><br />

This whole series of videos, even though it mostly focuses on Large Language Model, processing sequences of tokens, gives a good introduction to training neural networks,
at the level where it really works. (...) I worked for a moment in automotive company on SMT line, and general task for AOI (Automated Optical Inspection) is to find defects, 
incorrect positioning of the element, it is standing upright instead of lying down, or crooked, or it is missing in a given position where it should be etc.
I'm trying to thinking how this invention is game changer, to compare what it can do at the current level. And neural network really improve performance for these type of tasks.
Of course, the AOI system is a complex device that not only takes 2D pictures from camera, but also takes a 3D picture of the element using light, mirrors, and an angular camera.
But at the end you must decide if this is defects, false positive, negative, true positive. etc. But that was done by Yann LeCun also in 1989

LLM for "text completion" tasks is another game changer. This is still under development. A few years ago this type of algorithm was a fantasy, but today each of us can take 
it and train it for a specific task thanks to Andrej, and others who move forward this field. For a couple of dollars. To work as an assistant in daily tasks.
<br /><br />
At current level visual recognition models + LLM are already really useful when you think how many things of this type similar to AOI can be automated.
<br /><br />
But what Andrej does and his approach to LLM is something more. This is really helpful stuff. 
<br /><br />
And what I see some people take advantage for this purpose like Xiaomi 
https://emag.directindustry.com/2024/07/29/inside-xiaomis-ev-factory-where-the-company-produces-an-electric-car-every-76-seconds/ <br />
or https://emag.directindustry.com/2020/08/31/industry-4-0-and-the-luxury-industry-lamborghini-vuitton-fashion-automotive/ <br />
because this is really starting to be helpful in planning, cost management since it can already do the type of tasks that Andrej showed in his video.
And today we have access to it, because this is open source https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/tree/master. lol.
