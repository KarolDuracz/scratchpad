In theory, one neuron has inputs and outputs. And that's all it takes to make a decision. To calculate the next letter, word, token, etc. It's just math. Just for comparison with MLP. 
<br /><br />
What if we built an index of words and only calculated the prediction error for letters? For example, if the index under the letter "l" (lowercase l) contains possible combinations of "log","loss","let","length," then knowing the subsequent letters, we could calculate the error for the remainder and eliminate other possibilities (thus selecting the correct word) by writing subsequent letters. How do you build such a word index? The typical approach is to take the first letter of the word. And based on subsequent letters, we reduce the number of possible combinations, which is clearly visible in the HTML demo.

notebook with python code built on the pytorch Library - The first block, after training, simulates typing the words "log, loss" in few steps, i.e., char by char and probability distribution. The second listing, after training, allows us to type subsequent letters in the console and see possible word combinations.

HTML interactive app ( no needs any serwer, it's just  runs on web browser ) - THE MODEL DOESN'T TRAIN WELL, BUT ON THIS WORD INDEX IT IS ENOUGH FOR IT TO PREDICT WORDS RATHER CORRECTLY. This is not a 100% working implementation like the one shown by Andrej in his Ngram or MLP training approach -> https://github.com/EurekaLabsAI

demo to show how many words there are under a given letter - https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/MachineLearning/ML%20with%20EurekaLabs/23-09-2025%20-%20MLP%20vs%20INDEX%20for%20words%20approach/word_index.html

Training the model for the larger "WORDS" array in the HTML demo takes a bit longer. For example, if the word "float" isn't present, the model tries to predict anything anyway.

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/MachineLearning/ML%20with%20EurekaLabs/23-09-2025%20-%20MLP%20vs%20INDEX%20for%20words%20approach/extended%20WORDS%20table.png?raw=true)

But what interests me most about this approach is the elimination of other possibilities. That is, the more letters there are, the smaller the range of possibilities. It may not have given the correct prediction for "float", but the most accurate words are those with the first 3 letters "flo", the rest are eliminated because their "probs" value is too low. After [05:18:39] Epoch 53/60 â€” avg batch loss 1.3713 floor is higher than the filter for "float".

```
It may not work optimally, but it works to some extent. The letter "c" in the second larger WORDS
array provides a good example of how the system works ( there are more starting with the letter s ).
Checking the word count in word_index.html, for the letter "c" there are 19 words: c (19)

And for just one letter, "c," this HTML demo shows 60 steps:

catch 0.1271
ceil 0.0916
create 0.0560
continue 0.0546
case 0.0545
class 0.0542

For two letters, for example, "cl," there are 6 possibilities, then "ca" only 3, and for "co" as many as 7.
How should the system work? Example for "co"

word prob
constructor 0.5815
concat 0.1381
const 0.0807
console 0.0740
continue 0.0662
