<h2>TODO</h2>
This is probably for 2026. I have too much "tralala" in my head right now when I look at this.
<br /><br />
How the model can understand such visualizations, ask the right question about "what is the problem here" and finally how it can create such visualizations itself. Logical puzzles etc. Because when I look at the "thinking process" idea, people from AI field solve the next problem in line. And in fact, the model should have a deep understanding of not only what it sees when seeing the photo (reality like human's eyes), but also what the problem is, how to solve it, and in the next stages different visualizations and approaches.
