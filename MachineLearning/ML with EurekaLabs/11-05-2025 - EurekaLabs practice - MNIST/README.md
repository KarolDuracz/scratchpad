Update 24-05-2025 - I need to change my direction of study a bit. I've seen topics like this before, but... as I wrote, approaching it from the mathematical perspective was something I always missed. I was planning more demos, but I actually HAVE TO LEARN IT MYSELF because I have gaps in my education. Nice explanation, what I wanted to do in the next demos, i.e. how the network itself works. And this is a related topic [The EM Algorithm Clearly Explained (Expectation-Maximization Algorithm)
] https://youtu.be/3zbAsgCf1Sw - So I think it would be better to educate myself a bit in silence instead of making another demo from this point on. I will go back to learning ML and networks but I have to go better understand math behind it.
<br /><br />
btw. this is a good introduction to the MLP also https://youtu.be/3zbAsgCf1Sw?t=615 because from this moment 10:15 this is the approach that is used in neural networks, i.e. when we know the next token (label). A great example that complements the topic I think. But... 
<h2>TODO</h2>

It will be only after I get through MLP. I think first I should train these small MLPs well. Then nanoGPT. And so on until I get to running the 124 M model https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481 - There is still a lot of practice to be done on MLP vs nanoGPT. Before I get to this 124 M.
<br /><br />
But then visual learning. That's interesting. And I like how they approached building the database, generally the ideas behind this handwriting recognition model. In general, that card that some person filled out, those are really good ideas. I like this. But I think it will be in a few months. MLP is very interesting also, text understanding etc.
<br /><br />
BUT TODAY I AM STARTING THE TOPIC TO START PLANNING STEPS IN LEARNING

I've already done this exercise, but it was a run on keras, tensorflow, etc. to do this hello world. But I'm interested in the details - https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/MachineLearning/ML%20with%20EurekaLabs/Untitled11.ipynb

These cards were a damn smart approach
