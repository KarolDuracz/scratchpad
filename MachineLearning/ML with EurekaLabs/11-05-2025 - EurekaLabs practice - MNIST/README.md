<h2>TODO</h2>

It will be only after I get through MLP. I think first I should train these small MLPs well. Then nanoGPT. And so on until I get to running the 124 M model https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481 - There is still a lot of practice to be done on MLP vs nanoGPT. Before I get to this 124 M.
<br /><br />
But then visual learning. That's interesting. And I like how they approached building the database, generally the ideas behind this handwriting recognition model. In general, that card that some person filled out, those are really good ideas. I like this. But I think it will be in a few months. MLP is very interesting also, text understanding etc.
<br /><br />
BUT TODAY I AM STARTING THE TOPIC TO START PLANNING STEPS IN LEARNING

I've already done this exercise, but it was a run on keras, tensorflow, etc. to do this hello world. But I'm interested in the details - https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/MachineLearning/ML%20with%20EurekaLabs/Untitled11.ipynb

These cards were a damn smart approach
