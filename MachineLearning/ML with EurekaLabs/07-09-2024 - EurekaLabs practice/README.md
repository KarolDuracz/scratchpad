I don't wont to spam in Andrej's repositories. So, some stuff <b>that are not the essence of the problem or do not provide any real benefit to improve the code or model in main repo</b> but maybe useful for me I put here as " weekend practice " . The next biggest improvement in ML was AUTOGRAD ENGINE https://pytorch.org/blog/overview-of-pytorch-autograd-engine/ . And the "micrograd" repo is about this. But few things is not clear for me in this current code, so I have to break it down into parts...

Current repo copy is in .zip file.
