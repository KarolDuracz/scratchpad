Maybe useful tool - TODO
<br />
What if I've changed something in the transformers model so that it would read the page on an ongoing basis, or more precisely the documentation or repository on github, 
and based on the collected (observed) tokens it would learn something about it... that would be useful for analyzing the code.
<br />
Why manually search, click, read when the model can do some of this tedious work for you...
<br />
It should work like a search engine, only the model itself has to do it.

Maybe it will be useful, maybe not. Today I would definitely need a model that understands repos, e.g. DirectX or WINAPI better than me.
