<h2>Demo 10</h2>
This isn't the best choice for a demo that will be running a stress test. But it's an example of mixing CUDA functions with an application that renders some simple animation. This is a continuation of Demo5-9 using the APIs from nvcuda.dll and cudart.dll. And it's not 3D, as the name suggests. But it does provide some input into the next steps, like adding mouse, keyboard, and 3D support in the future.

This is an example from the code at the very top in main.cpp. It uses very little GPU and memory. <b>In the upper right corner is the "Objects" menu. </b> Add individual items there, or enable automatic addition of 100 every second.
