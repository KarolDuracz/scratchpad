In MS Studio 2019 and Windows 8.1 today I have a problem to create "hello world" driver. Few months ago I  installed MSVS 2022 version and worked well, but right now this works only for 
newer Windows 10<  etc. So, at this moment there is no "hello world" example. I remember when I first try to create syntetic driver module, this code is somewhere in WINAPI DOCS in drivers 
section. At this moment some stuff for reading only...

And very interesting and helpful videos about kernel debugging etc in on this YT channel<br />
