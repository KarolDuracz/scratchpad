<h2>Common algorithms</h2>
for the first shot basic algorithms but more in detail. I'm not making a list for now. It will come out in the wash what comes first.
Maybe create folder for each one here.

Some of the algorithms are described well by this guy in few programming languages - https://github.com/nayuki -
