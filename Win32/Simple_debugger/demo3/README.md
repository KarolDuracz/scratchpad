3-11-2024 - Back to this book (https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Praktyczna-inzynieria-wsteczna,622427233,p.html?srsltid=AfmBOoooy1-iohVrjoNQa9FmNiLFVdlV_U9RGb8TYEa0cIq5CHVFa1hk) - Gynvael Coldwind, Mateusz Jurczyk - Praktyczna in≈ºynieria wsteczna. There is a chapter written by hasherezade. And some demos uploaded to github as explanation in the code https://github.com/hasherezade/demos/blob/master/inject_shellcode/src/add_thread.h . <br /><br />

In this demo3 I want to take a closer look at CreateRemoteThread - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread
<br /><br />
In this add_thread.h from hasherezade github is there function run_shellcode_in_new_thread1 which demonstrate how run in some way CreateRemoteThread. And few other tips and tricks.
<br /><br />
1. Ok. For this particualr demo3 first we need create guest app.
```
// compile with /link user32.lib
// cl simple_demo.c /link User32.lib

#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	MessageBoxA(NULL, L"hello", L"test", MB_OK);
	while(1);
}
```
Compile it from commnad. But first we need setup environemnt for x64 bits. Following this guide (https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/tree/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo2) or find in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Visual Studio 2019\Visual Studio Tools\VC\x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019.But we need setup environment for CL.exe for x64 bits in this case. Because host system and all processes is running as 64 bits.
```
 cl simple_demo.c /link User32.lib // compile

 cmd.exe > simple_demo.exe // and run
```
This app check if MessageBox is working and then jump to infinite loop.
<br /><br />
2. Ok, next go to main project (https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/Project15/Project15/main.cpp) . This is quite a mishmash. But the uncommented code is what is currently to compile as a project and run. The rest is a few other tests of the same thing. But just compile this code as is and run it. Only change line 118 to process to debug. 
```
DWORD pid = GetProcessIdByName("notepad.exe");
```
I tested it on 2 64 bit processes. simple_demo.exe and notepad.exe. For notepad.exe put like this GetProcessIdByName("notepad.exe"); that's it. This find process using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot etc. and return handle to process and PID. Look at implemenation in .../Project15/main.cpp
<br /><br />
<h2>3. First run.</h2>
<br />
1. Compile Project15<br />
2. In CMD.exe jump to path. In my case "C:\Users\kdhome\source\repos\Project15\Debug\main_test" to simple_demo.exe<br />
3. Rus simple_demo.exe (cmd > simple_demo.exe)<br />

4. Craete another CMD.exe but as Administrator <br />
5. Jump with this administrator CMD to "C:\Users\kdhome\source\repos\Project15\x64\Debug" - remember this is x64 so jump to \x64\Debug\<br />
6. In Project15 change line 118 . Compile it with CTRL + SHIFT + B . And run in CMD as administrator Project15.exe<br />
7. This create inside simple_demo.exe process new thread (in this example with TID 11704) - Right now is suspend.<br />

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/screen%202%20-%20create%20remote%20thread.png?raw=true)

8. Run WinDbg x64 as administrator<br />

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/3%20-run%20windbg.png?raw=true)

9. Press CTRL + C to stop Project15.exe<br />

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/4%20-%20CTRL%20V%20to%20stop%20project15%20exe.png?raw=true)

10. In windbg press "r" to check registers. But this is not necessary at this moment. Then find MessageBoxA using <br />

```
x user32!MessageBox*
```

and then set break point to address USER32!MessageBoxA 

```
 bp 00007ffd`2a908320
```
And press "g" to run again<br />

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/5%20-%20run%20g.png?raw=true)

11. Next you need to select process in ProcessExlporer and resume thread. 

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/6%20-%20cd.png?raw=true)

12. Then debugger hit in break point . Show registers using "r". Important register is RDX here.

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/7%20-%20when%20hit%20bp%20look%20like%20that.png?raw=true)

13. Execute few instructions for example like that using "p" and "t" command in windbg. From MessageBoxA we jump to MessageBoxTimeoutA and then inside this will be call    MBToWCSEx

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/8%20-%20ida%201.png?raw=true)

14. Fast look to IDA and user32.dll

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/9%20-%20cd.png?raw=true)

15. Ok, press "r" in windbg and enter to run process. This execute thread and show MessageBox as you see on the screen bellow.

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/10%20-%20press%20g%20and%20enter%20and%20get%20message%20box.png?raw=true)

<h3>For this issue we create Remote Thread inside another process and run step by step using WinDbg successfully.</h3>
We can create again and again this remote process using this Project15.exe and do in loop this things. Ad nauseam. But that's not the point.
<hr>
<br />
Ok, now we run "notepad.exe"<br />
Back to point #6 -  In Project15 change line 118 . Compile it with CTRL + SHIFT + B . And run in CMD as administrator Project15.exe<br />
And change in line 118 to DWORD pid = GetProcessIdByName("simple_demo.exe");<br />
Open notepad.exe - for example with Windows + R keys and type "notepad.exe" and ENTER key.<br />
And again, compile Project15. And then run from CMD as admnistrator. (we see in ProcessExplorer new thread inside notepad.exe)<br />
And then, run WinDbg x64 as administrator<br />
And then press CTRL + C in CMD to stop Project 15.exe when the remote thread with suspend state is created inside notepad process.<br />

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/11%20-%20for%20notepad.png?raw=true)

In WinDbg if already is running Break current process (CTRL + Break) and detach debuggee following top menu Debug > Break | Debug > Detach Debuggee<br />
Or run fresh start WinDbg x64 as Administrator. And attach to process notepad.exe in my example with PID 7224.

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/12%20-%20notepad%20is%20debug.png?raw=true)

And again we need set break point at MessageBoxA function and then run "g" command again.

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/13%20-%20we%20need%20set%20break%20point.png?raw=true)

And then click "resume" in ProcessExplorer

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/14%20-%20click%20resume.png?raw=true)

And on the next picture we see something is wrong with CMP instruction. This is weird address do DS. And this based on value from RDX register. In the example with "simple_demo.exe" if you look above we had a normal address.

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/15%20-%20result.png?raw=true)

Ok, now detach debuggee and see ERROR (crash)

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/16%20-%20error.png?raw=true)

Looking into Event Viewer probably won't tell us much either, but I don't know how to read it very well. Only that it's somewhere in user32.dll and that we have an access error (Access denied)

![dump](https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/Win32/Simple_debugger/demo3/pics/17%20-%20access%20denied%205.png?raw=true)

And this is a topic I need to delve into more deeply. This is probably about ACL etc. things.
<br /><br />
If you run this without debugger you will open the same result - crash application with code error 5.
