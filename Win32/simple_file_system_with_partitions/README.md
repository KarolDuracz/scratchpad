try to build simple file system with partitions
<br /><br />
In this file is 3 code example. First use zlib. But desn't work. Second which is right now compiled generate error. 
This example creates a secured file  VIRTUAL_DISK_NAME L"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\virtual_disk.bin". And I try to test writing and reading.
The main idea is to create secure file to hashing files into it like text or word files, images etc.

TODO - to fix
