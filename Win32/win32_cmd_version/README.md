For implementation functionality as exec, etc to run this as comommad this repo show how to build something like that<br />

Series "Konsola (TTY) pod Linuxem" is ok as example how to build console
Gynvael's Livestream #80: Konsola (TTY) pod Linuxem (part 1)

<br /><br />
To create minimalist system RTOS with context switching mechanism etc look at<br />
https://github.com/rosly/rados <br />
and https://programistamag.pl/programista-11-2015-42/

PS: Smiehalf seems to have gone out of business, but RADOS is a nice lesson in how to write an RTOS. For this case I have in here copy as "rados-master.zip" this repo.

<br /><br />
But for better understand from electronic side. here you can see how to create a TTY console on FPGA and mechanism from this repo in low level <br />

This guy wrote an incredibly helpful article to play with microcontrolers like ARM Cortex M0 in series "Małe jest piękne" [73-75]

For me this is another topic to correspond to CMD / TTY console
