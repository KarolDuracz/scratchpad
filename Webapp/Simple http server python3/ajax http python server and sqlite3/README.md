AJAX + python http serve + sqlite3 - tiny example
<br />
1. How to run<br />
<b>python server2.py</b><br /> - but this .db file from this repo is not needed, because python script create own .db file if not exists.
2. Like on this picutre. Open 2 page in web browser. Open http://localhost:8080. To open logs http://localhost:8080/logs<br />
3. Click on the button "send signal" <br />

This might be use to save those task (collect data)  for example from this app --> https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/tree/main/Webapp/Simple%20http%20server%20python3/pomodoro-app <br />
One thing that might be useful for this application is that after clicking "start" it will save the information to the server and sqlite3 database on the server side. And user can list all logs call up /logs in adrress bar.
