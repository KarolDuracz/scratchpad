As I review this topic I realize more and more that this is a long list of topics that make up the entire system. I'm talking about the bootloader and what happens at the beginning.
Even before the bootloader itself, there is the topic of the BIOS and UEFI itself. And the MBR and GPT partitions. This requires at least a sketch. Then there is the bootloader phase. And then the x86 system, which starts with ACPI, Timers, Interrupts, Watchdog, I/O ports etc.
For each topic I need a separate folder here. There is no detailed list of topics yet. But today I know that I need to systematize my knowledge on this subject in some way.
<br /><br />
And how threads works, how multiprocessor system works, how scheduler works on x86 Linux/Windows from the inside etc etc. All this things is on the Internet or in the manufacturer's documentation, but I want to systematize it here in this repo at least a bit.
<br /><br />
And finally something about USB, CAN, SERIAL, etc. And again, there are many cool materials and books about USB itself etc, but...
<br /><br />
I think this needs to be done at least as a sketch of how it works and looks before attempting to make a virtual machine and emulate devices. Because I set myself a "goal" to do it as an exercise. And in the win32 folder here is the beginning of a topic about it, but a few months later I know that it is a more complex topic and it cannot be done on 1 page "README.md", it must be divided into subtopics, stages, etc. This requires breaking down into stages and plans...
<br /><br />
But at the moment I am not interested in delving into the subject so much that I understand how to build my own CPU or architecture in detail at the electronics level. I am only interested in understanding the basics, to reach the next level in education. To use knowledge and these technology and devices in practice. Because we live in times when many people have done Reverse Enginering, even Intel 4004. Why do the same thing twice? Something else has to be done here...
