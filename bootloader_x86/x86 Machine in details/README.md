As I review this topic I realize more and more that this is a long list of topics that make up the entire system. I'm talking about the bootloader and what happens at the beginning.
Even before the bootloader itself, there is the topic of the BIOS and UEFI itself. And the MBR and GPT partitions. This requires at least a sketch. Then there is the bootloader phase. And then the x86 system, which starts with ACPI, Timers, Interrupts, etc.
For each topic I need a separate folder here. There is no detailed list of topics yet. But today I know that I need to systematize my knowledge on this subject in some way.
<br /><br />
And how threads works, how multiprocessor system works, how scheduler works on x86 Linux/Windows from the inside etc etc. All this things is on the Internet or in the manufacturer's documentation, but I want to systematize it here in this repo at least a bit.
