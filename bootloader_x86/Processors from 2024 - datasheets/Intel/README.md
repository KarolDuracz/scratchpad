<h2>Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V Series Processors</h2>
Looking on Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V Series Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2, doing a quick review of what's in Vol 1/2 I see similar things that are in my 2011 and 2014 hardware. But this is backward compatibility, looking at page 32 about PCI header, memory mapping page 39, etc, so... But this series of systems are SoCs from what I see that have PCH functionalities built into one system, i.e. USB controller, Display etc. But I wonder what the NPU system and the new GPU are. As a typical user, for now, what was in '11, '14 is enough for me. But Machine Learning field doing progress. I don't know how UEFI protocols work with this SoC, but if Microsoft Windows 11 specs writes about it, it means it is supported. So I can still practice on older chips as an introduction to newer I think. There is no big GAP between those chips.
