Sorry, but I can't write anything more here for now. I managed to compile a custom Windows kernel based on ver 10.0.26100.1 in yet another attempt after few weeks. After packing this to .ISO image is 386 MB. But there is only a desktop, no explorer.exe in this minimal configuration. There is no calc.exe etc. etc. there is not even "findstr" to filter the search in CMD. Very minimalist system to start build something from scratch :)
