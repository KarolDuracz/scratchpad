<h3>Demo 3 - a folder with images that are chronological and will help understand the process of building the demo 18 and pieces of code</h3>

I wrote that there would be an analysis. But looking at it now, I've basically given up because I can't share everything publicly anyway. They're also private. This is the part I can share TO HELP. CHRONOLOGICALLY, from 10/16/2025 - 6:55 PM (Polish time) to 10/18/2025 - 3:50 PM – that's what I did, more or less. I make notes on the fly so I don't get lost later. It's very jumbled and incomplete, BUT IT MAY HELP YOU PARTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHAT I WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO. You can find these snippets of code or chat in what I shared here in demo18. And build a chronological picture of what I was doing in this demo, step by step. Comments on images are in Polish, but overall chat and conversation with GPT is in English.
