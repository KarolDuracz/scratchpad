> The images aren't uploaded to github here to repo. I found them on Google. They weren't licensed. But I wanted to see what it looked like in REAL HW, how those pixels would be rendered. The images are really cool. I don't intend to steal anyone's work. I didn't ask the authors if I could. I was just looking for something Halloween-themed and to see what you looked like in that demo. And these seemed cool for that demo. Nothing more. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NO IMAGES IN THIS REPOSITORY, THERE ARE ONLY SCREENSHOTS.
