<h2>UiApp equivalent - simple demo</h2>
Default UiApp is here https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Application/UiApp - But it has a structure, some API that can be used to 
scale it further. Current UEFIs already look great. it's not clunky anymore, it's just a cool design. But above all, it has to work. But there is another demo that tries to build something like this, just like UiApp does.

<h3>Demo 1</h3>

<h3>Demo 2</h3>
Very poor quality code, many errors. Types mismatch. BUT IT WORKS. But probably only on EmulatorPkg and possibly QEMU. Obviously there is something wrong with the menu drawing.
