This is already an old story, but still for me the best area to play with ML and deep learning. Somewhere around 2011 I started playing around with creating an interactive board for creating tactics from a bird's eye view and first person (without going into details). At that time, WEBGL was still in its infancy. If I remember correctly. And of course at that time I knew nothing about machine learning and neural networks. At that point I only had a very simple 2D demo with moving players (circles with numbers on html canvas with using tween.js for smooth animations). But it was an interesting area to explore statistics that can improve a player's and team's performance. Today I don't feel like doing it anymore, but for me it's still the best direction to go if I'm going to do something with ML, train networks for a specific purpose. To learn on practice with ML and train DNN. And analyzing the game is something interesting for me. But it's rather unlikely that it will be a serious application. If I come back to it, it will be only for my own satisfaction, to close this topic from over 10 years ago.
<br /><br />
This will be probably my playground for Machine Learning / Deep / Vision / RL learning stuff to improve skills to train neural networks. And nothing else.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
<i>Today I'm not a football fan anymore. Important here is to stay in main reason about 3D graphics development history and hardware for this purpose and deep learning / computer vision roots. Because improvement on this field is come from not app like this, but exploring fundamental issues such as speech, vision, learning. Development and progress in this field (ML) comes from improving the model for specific tasks such as computer vision etc. Don't forget about this btw. </i>
<br /><br />
But, first start from this ===> https://github.com/KarolDuracz/scratchpad/blob/main/MachineLearning/LLM%20for%20a%20specific%20task/README.md
<br /><br />
btw. Fun fact. There are movies about this topic SPORT + STATISTICS. And one of the inspiring movies about this topic is Moneyball (2011) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/). This is not about football/soccer but about baseball, but this film based on true story. So, there were people who had already tried this approach. But this is only film, and many a lot of the stories are probably embellished. But personally I liked this movie.
<br /><br />
At the end of this topic. A quick note on why this defeats the purpose. The only sense I see today in creating this type of application is only so that the team can create more opportunities under the goal at 11-18 meters from the goal for the attackers. And for better organization of the game in general. This counts during the 90 minutes of the game. HOW TO PLAY TO CREATE ACTIONS AND PLAYERS CREATE SPACE AND PUT THE BALL OUT ON 100% create of the goal. And in real time analysis divergences relative to the ideal model / scenario. In other words. It's about measuring the quality of the attack, i.e. the players' movements and creating actions towards the opponent's goal and trying to position and pass the ball in such a way that a goal is scored. This is worth measuring. And reactions on the pitch like this. (...) but this is an already past. I can only have fun with it to confirm my arguments and beliefs, for myself only. Today I feel like it's a waste of my time for doing this, but I want to close this topic somehow! There are much more interesting problems to solve today and opportunities, there is no point in getting fixated and blocking ourselves on that anymore...
<br /><br />
A small example
<br /><br />
0 -------x------|----|-------x----G-|--|-----------|--|------x-------|------|---|----|-|-|- 90
<br /><br />
x - shots on target<br />
G - goal 1:0 for the opponent<br />
| - attempted shot on goal but out of goal<br />
<br />
This is an example of how the course of a match of an average team not fighting for the championship can look like. They have some expectations and theoretically a bigger advantage on the pitch and on paper. But in the '31 minute they score an own goal. And for the rest of the match until the '90 minute they try to chase the result. And for example, at the end of the match, let's look at the statistics, shots on goal 15, but only 3 on target. <br /><br />
But what did these actions look like and why were they effective or not. Did the striker not get any ball to shoot at goal in clear position to shot? How could it have been played differently. There are many such issues. And this can be simulated and measured.
<br /><br />
Update - 24-09-2024 - A different approach is to measure time between changing the position of the players and direction to opponent or following the ball movement. In other words. The model can "watch" a video of a match and predict the direction a player will go, the direction the ball will go, the next move. And this may seem like a relatively simple task at first glance, but...  Anyway. It might be interesting.

Update 31-12-2024 - I wrote some nonsense here about ML. It doesn't matter in general, but to be clear. Such applications are known not to be a reason for the development of ML (AI) because it's about the way of learning, about how to teach Perceptron / Neuron. It's just about how to teach it, how to train. And that's grown now into training entire networks, called deep networks. But at its core, it's just about how you train machines to understand, et cetera, in some way. (...) Ok. I'll probably make a demo of this app because I want to learn something about computer vision and simulation with current ML algorithms. And this also touches upon issues of 3D graphics, in which I also need to improve my skills. So that seems OK, for this particular challenge.
<br /><br />
Update 06-02-2025 - I'm thinking about whether it makes sense to do it. But as an exercise to remind myself of the basics of 3D graphics, at least YES. And start something about machine learning with visual learning. But machine learning itself has greater potential than this. But the limitation now is dataset. The model itself will only learn as much as it gets data. This is probably the next problem to solve in generally for AI field. People who created these algorithms, like Geoffrey Hinton, are right when they say that the AI, if it were the AI ​​we think it is, would learn speech, language, etc autonomously. But that's what development looks like. They've adapted to current opportunities and technology and taken the first step...
