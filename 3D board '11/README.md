This is already an old story, but still for me the best area to play with ML and deep learning. Somewhere around 2011 I started playing around with creating an interactive board for creating tactics from a bird's eye view and first person (without going into details). At that time, WEBGL was still in its infancy. If I remember correctly. And of course at that time I knew nothing about machine learning and neural networks. At that point I only had a very simple 2D demo with moving players (circles with numbers on html canvas with using tween.js for smooth animations). But it was an interesting area to explore statistics that can improve a player's and team's performance. Today I don't feel like doing it anymore, but for me it's still the best direction to go if I'm going to do something with ML, train networks for a specific purpose. To learn on practice with ML and train DNN. And analyzing the game is something interesting for me. But it's rather unlikely that it will be a serious application. If I come back to it, it will be only for my own satisfaction, to close this topic from over 10 years ago.

This will be probably my playground for Machine Learning / Deep / Vision / RL learning stuff to improve skills to train neural networks. And nothing else.

<i>Today I'm not a football fan anymore. Important here is to stay in main reason about 3D graphics development history and hardware for this purpose and deep learning / computer vision roots. Because improvement on this field is come from not app like this, but exploring fundamental issues such as speech, vision, learning. Development and progress in this field (ML) comes from improving the model for specific tasks such as computer vision etc. Don't forget about this btw. </i>
